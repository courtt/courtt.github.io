							I am PhD candidate at the University of Pittsburgh studying supernova remnants using a Cosmic Ray,
							Hydrodynamic, Non-Equilibrium Ionization code (ChN) and X-ray spectroscopy under the supervision of Dr. Carles Badenes.
							My research focus is on studying Type Ia supernovae progenitor scenarios by 
							simulating supernova remnants in different circumstellar environments and comparing their spectra to observed Chandra spectra. 
							Outside of science, I love to cook, camp, and brew beer. <br>

								<b>Modeling the X-Ray Emission of Type Ia Supernova Remnants in Different Circumstellar Environments</b><br>I simulate supernova remnants while varying the circumstellar structure to create a grid of models. 
								Supernova remnants allow us to probe the interaction between the supernova ejecta and the ambient medium. Above is a simulated XRISM spectrum with uniform ambient medium density and different Type Ia explosion models. 
								I will be presenting a poster on this topic at the Supernova Remnants and Their Progenitors workshop in August.

								<b>Multiplicity Statistics of Stars in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy: Comparison to the Milky Way</b><br>
								We compare the statistics of stars in the Sgr dSph to analogs from the MW by creating analog samples using a k-d tree selecting for relevant stellar properties. We find that the Sgr dwarf spheroidal has systematically
								higher multiplicity than similar stars in the Milky Way.
